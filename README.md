# Python_Medium_Level-Python-Machine-Learning-Journey
A collection of projects I built while moving from core Python to intermediate programming and preparing for Machine Learning.

This repository documents my learning journey as I strengthen Python fundamentals, build medium-level projects, and prepare for machine learning.
The content is split into three clean categories.
